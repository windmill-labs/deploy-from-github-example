This demo repository showcases how GitHub Actions can be used to deploy scripts
to Windmill.

It uses the 
[`windmill-gh-action-deploy`](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill-gh-action-deploy)
action to deploy the script to Windmill.

You can find the Action on the GitHub marketplace: 
[here](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-windmill-dev)

The action relies on GitHub Actions Secrets, see the 
[official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/secrets) for
more information.
